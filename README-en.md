# "ViMaker"

A tool that allows you to create sequences of events related to displaying a 3D object.

---

### Overview


This project aims to help presenters sharing the **volumetric data** to the audience. Main functionality of ViMaker consists of making a sequence of various events, such as *zooming*, *camera movement* and *angle*. 
Sequences makes it possible for a speaker to explain the main idea about the volumetric object as the audience can get a right focus on it. We look forward to creating a video export system in the future.
